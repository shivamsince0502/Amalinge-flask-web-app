# Amalinge-flask-web-app
This project is about a web app having company ads and a feedback form to use build customer - seller bond.
I build this whole project with 3 main technologies used and they are as follows:
Bootstrap : I used this for the frontend of my website.
Python's Flask framework : This is an amazing framework to work on web dev as backend.
MySql database: Everybody knows this RDBMS.
